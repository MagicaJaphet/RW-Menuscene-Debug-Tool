Idle_depth_explanation|Idle depths are used for the scene's random focus when the mouse is not being used, and can affect the blurriness of a scene in general when applicable. If no idle depths exist, the game chooses the random depth value of an image instead.

shader_explanation|Shaders are used to change the way the pixels of the image are interpreted. Basic takes the image as it is with no extra steps, while other shaders involve various mathmatical applications. Depth maps are the black and red images included in base images, where red represents how much the camera should influence those pixels.
